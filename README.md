# Developer Test iOS App

A simple iOS app to test out our knowledge of UITableViews

Open `DevelopersTest.xcodeproj` to run.

## Tasks

- Add button to add developer to list of developers that don't know iOS
- Add in header per section
- Swipe to delete
- Swipe to move user from bottom section to top section

I'm free to walk through how to solve these whenever people want
